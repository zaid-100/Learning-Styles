<h1> Learning Styles </h1>
<p1> Although the arguments presented by Derek Muller and Carol Dweck were very different, they had many similarities if we dug a bit deeper.</p1>
<p2>The primary argument coming from Carol was how a growth Mindset can help kids and students in growing and performing better at school, while a fixed mindset stops them from growing altogether. </p2>
<p3>Carol gave 3 reasons for the existence of a fixed mindset:</p3>
<ol>
<li> Trying to look smart at all costs </li>
<li> The skill/knowledge is supposed to come naturally </li>
<li> Wanting to hide mistakes and deficiencies </li>
</ol>
<p4> If we analyze these 3 reasons we can relate it to the intrinsic need of approval that we, as humans, exhibit. These are ways of thinking that keep any person in a “bubble” and makes them never be challenged; and as Carol shows later in her video, growth occurs when our brains are challenged. Correction of our mistakes helps resolve it for future and makes our brains better.</p4>
<p5>The ways of achieving this growth mindset as described by carol were to have people directly learn about it through courses and videos and also through creating a culture where a growth mindset is appreciated, as shown by the example of the Native American school.</p5>
<br>
  <p6> Although Derek’s approach towards learning styles was seemingly very different, the effects of these approaches were similar. He asked questions that appeared straightforward, but upon a second thought were very counter-intuitive. Such questions enabled the brain of the interviewee to enter a thought-overdrive, similar to the brains of the growth-mindset students in carol’s study, enabling them to think but not giving them the answers until their brain functions and slowly gets closer to the real answer.</p6>
  <br>
<p7>By putting the interviewee and the audience on the pedestal to answer a question so seemingly simple like “where do trees get their mass from”, Derek forces the people with the “fixed mindset” to think and challenge their presuppositions or to formulate an entirely new thought. The interviewees were in a position where they had to answer the questions by coming up with their own ideas, in order to look smart at all costs. They might also realize that knowledge also comes upon thinking and voluntary action, not “naturally”. And finally, the interviewees were unable to hide their mistakes and deficiencies as it was an on-tape interview. However, in realizing that they got close to the answer by themselves once given the answer, a person would think that thinking about anything voluntarily can actually help a person understand the concept better.</p7>
<br>
  <p8>So, although very different on the first look, the two ways of learning are very similar in their philosophy.</p8>
                               <h2> The Core Philosophy of Learning</h2>
<p9>The core philosophy of learning, it seems, for both Derek and Carol, is for the subjects to be challenged. One other learning technique which is widely appreciated among many experts and academics is a technique used by one of the most famous physicists, who was also quoted by Derek, Richard Feynman. </p9>
<br>
  <p10> His technique was such that if a person needs to reinforce an idea or make their concepts better, they should try and explain it to a person who is completely new to the idea. This also challenges the person; by trying to explain a concept completely new to a different person, a close attention to detail is given and ideas are challenged and presuppositions are many times tossed aside. This learning way is commonly known as The Feynman Technique.</p10>
